Research about the Activity lifecycle, get information, code on how to use it
[onCreate],[onStart], [onResume],[onPause],[onStop],[onDestroy]


The Android Activity lifecycle is a set of states an Android activity transitions through from creation to destruction, managed by the Android operating system. It uses callback methods like onCreate(), onStart(), onPause(), onStop(), onRestart(), and onDestroy() to allow developers to add specific behavior in response to user actions and system events. Understanding these states is crucial for managing app resources, ensuring a smooth user experience, and creating a robust and responsive application.
 
Key States and Callback Methods
An activity moves between states as the user navigates in and out of the app. 
onCreate():
Called when the activity is first created. Used for initial setup and binding the user interface with its layout. 
onStart():
Called when the activity becomes visible to the user, though it may not be in the foreground. 
onResume():
Called when the activity enters the foreground and is ready for user interaction. 
onPause():
Called when the activity loses focus and is no longer in the foreground, for example, if another activity takes over. It's a point to save user data and release resources, according to this Medium article. 
onStop():
Called when the activity is no longer visible to the user, such as when the app moves to the background. The system may destroy it to reclaim memory. 
onRestart():
Called when a previously stopped activity is about to be started again. 
onDestroy():
Called before the activity is destroyed. This is the final cleanup
